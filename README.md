# Simulating Shor's Algorithm to Break RSA Encryption

This project simulates Shor‚Äôs algorithm using Qiskit to demonstrate how RSA encryption could, in theory, be broken by quantum computer. 

Since **order finding(period estimation)** is the key quantum step in breaking RSA, this project focuses on how a quantum computer can estimate the period `r` (order `r`) of a number `a mod n`  The implementation includes:

- Modular exponentiation as a unitary gate
- Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
- Visualization of circuit behavior for small composite numbers (e.g, `n = 15`)
- Discrepancy (Limitation of QPE)
- [Optional] Comparison: Classical vs. Quantum order finding
- [Optional] Classical post-processing to factor `n` using the found order `r`
- Limitation and Final thoughts
 
The goal is to illustrate the **quantum speedup** enabled by QPE in Shor's algorithm. 
An optional section shows how full RSA factorization could proceed once the period is known.

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to current hardware limitations, this simulation only works with very small values (e.g., n = 15).
